# Tractography.jl

This Julia package aims at tractography by taking advantage of **parallel and specific hardwares (*e.g.* GPU).** Tractography aims at reconstructing white matter fiber bundles using diffusion-weighted MRI. It thus aim to study the structural connectivity of the brain.

## üì¶ Installation

Assuming that you already have Julia correctly installed, it suffices to import `Tractography.jl` in the standard way:

`import Pkg; Pkg.add("Tractography")`

In Julia, the present package seems to be the only one focused on tractography.

There is also [JuliaNeuroscience](https://github.com/JuliaNeuroscience).

## A word on performance

The examples which follow have not **all** been written with the goal of performance but rather simplicity.

However, note that this code was used to sample 500 000 000 000 streamlines on GPU for a recent publication.
